# tcprust
Proof I can read a book.

This is the last project in the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html). 

It's a little TCP server!

It's also multithreaded, with a [ThreadPool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool) which can handle up to [4 (four)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4) simultaneous requests!
